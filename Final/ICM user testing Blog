ICM user testing:

I received important feedback from user testing with my coursemates. The following are some important points mentioned:

1. The UI is confusing sometimes when the user has to go back to the main screen.
2. A game can be made that makes it more fun to interact with it.
3. Explain what each mode does like a tutorial so that its easier to understand.

I plan to make these changes and simpify the UI. I also plan to make a walk through in the beginning so that its much easier to understand whats happening.

Here is the initial prototype version
